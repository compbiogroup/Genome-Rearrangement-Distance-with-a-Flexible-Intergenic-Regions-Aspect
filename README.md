# Genome Rearrangement Distance with a Flexible Intergenic Regions Aspect

This project contains three datasets inside of the Dataset folder:
- REV: This dataset was created exclusively by applying reversal events.
- TRANS: This dataset was created exclusively by applying transposition events.
- REVTRANS: This dataset was created using both reversal and transposition events.

Inside of each dataset folder, the names of the files have the following pattern:
``S<size>F<flex>O<operations>.in``
Where `<size>`, `<flex>`, and `<operations>` represent the size of the instances, the degree of flexibility associated with each intergenic region, and the percentage of operations applied based on the size of the instances. Besides, each file contains 1.000 instances.
